Coin Change Problem Maximum Number of ways

Given a value N, if we want to make change for N cents, 
and we have infinite supply of each of S = { S1, S2, .. , Sm} valued coins,
how many ways can we make the change? The order of coins doesnâ€™t matter.

Example:
for N = 4 and S = {1,2,3}, there are four solutions: {1,1,1,1},{1,1,2},{2,2},{1,3}. So output should be 4.


///////Comparision why knapsack
We have a choice for each element of s[] and we have a capacity of N 

We have below params:-

N    ======>   W
S[]  ======>   wt[]

Here we can take elements of S[] any number of times, ie, we can repeat so its unbounded knapsack
